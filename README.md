# xamarin.forms-admob
Currently, this repository is not working due to <a href="https://ads-developers.googleblog.com/2018/10/announcing-v1700-of-android-google.html">changes made by Google</a> that now require adding your AdMob app ID in your AndroidManifest file. Soon I will upload an update that will solve this problem.
